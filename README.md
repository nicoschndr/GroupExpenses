| **methodic and organizational processing**             | 
|--------------------------------------------------------| 
| YouTrack issueboard for task management                | 
| gitLab for version control                             |  
| Meaningful commits messages describing the changes     |               
| User centered design                                   | 
| Structrual framing in weekly meetings                  | 
| Git-workflow (Featurebranches, Merge Requests)         | 


| **documentation**                                                                        |

| a software docu is in the repository                                                                           | 
| the most important functions have been described with an api doku                                              |

## Planning
| **Data structures and classes**                                                                                            | 
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| All classes, functions and data structures have been recorded in UML-Diagrams to plan the application.         |

## User Centered Design
| **usability**                                                                                                  | 
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| to ensure usability, two usability tests were carried out during development. The first with figma. the second on the developed app and an emulator with android studio.                                                               |

| **user stories**                                                                                               | 
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| Based on the results of the planning processes, user stories were written.                                     | 
| A mockup and a moodboard were designed to prepare the whole coding process.                                    | 
| Based on the user stories, issues were written for Youtrack that have been used as a basis to plan the workload.|
